# Upload-to-dropbox
You can now automatically upload files to your dropbox.
Make sure your inputs are correct. If they are you can upload your files to your dropbox easily. Note: Shift right clicking on a file gives you the option to copy the path. You can use that to paste the path into this script. Make sure you remove the quotation marks. Good luck.
